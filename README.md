# Getting started with Open LLMs
Intro workshop on Open LLMs at AIUK2025

## Programme

1. What are open LLMs?
2. What can you do with them?
3. [Ollama](ollama.ipynb)
4. Huggingface [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alan-turing-institute/open-llms-101/blob/main/open_llms_huggingface.ipynb)

## Instructions for participants

The hands-on part of the workshop will take place mostly in a Google Colab notebook. To execute the programme, you will need a [Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en). A background in Python is not needed, we'll just proceed step-by-step.

We will also interact with Ollama, a library for running LLMs locally. Please, install Ollama before the workshop following the setup instructions at the beginning of [this notebook]((ollama.ipynb).

People familiar with Python can follow the tutorial locally on their machines, the workshop relies just on a few libraries listed [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-llms-101/blob/main/pyproject.toml).
